# KUBAM!

![Build Status](http://1db27123.ngrok.io/api/badges/CiscoUcs/KUBaM/status.svg?branch=v2.0)

Deploy Solutions on Cisco UCS with a Simple Open Source Light-Weight Bare Metal Installer

No PXE, DHCP, TFTP, or complicated network setup required. You don't even have to map MAC addresses. KUBAM turns your bare metal into liquid that can be molded and modified to satisfy all your deepest darkest datacenter requirements.

## Introduction
We started with a [blog on PXEless automated installs](https://communities.cisco.com/community/technology/datacenter/compute-and-storage/ucs_management/blog/2017/04/25/pxe-less-automated-installation-of-centosredhat-on-ucs). From there we evolved to an open source tool that could make this process easier.
